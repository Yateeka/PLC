# Python Syntax Highlighting Editor

This project is a standalone text editor developed using Python's Tkinter GUI library. It supports real-time syntax highlighting, multiple themes, Python keyword autocomplete, bracket matching, and dynamic line numbers. The editor is designed to provide an interactive coding experience similar to lightweight IDEs, focusing specifically on Python code.

## Features

- Real-time syntax highlighting for Python syntax elements including:
  - Keywords
  - Built-in functions
  - Strings, numbers, booleans, collections
  - Comments and operators
- Bracket matching with automatic closing
- Autocomplete suggestions for Python keywords
- Dynamic line number display that syncs with scrolling
- Multiple theme options including:
  - Light
  - Dark
  - Monokai
  - Dracula
  - Nord
  - Solarized (Light & Dark)
- Status bar showing real-time line and column info
- File operations:
  - Open `.py` or any text file
  - Save current text as `.py` or other formats
- Integrated keyboard shortcut menu

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with most Python installations)

## Installation and Running

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
3. Run the editor with the following command:

   ```bash
   python syntax_editor.py
## How to Use

- The main text area allows you to write or paste Python code.
- Use the **File** menu to open or save files.
- Change the theme from the **Themes** menu to suit your preferences.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl + O**: Open file  
- **Ctrl + S**: Save file  
- **Ctrl + Z / Ctrl + Y**: Undo / Redo  
- **Ctrl + T**: Toggle between Light and Dark themes

Additional Features:
- Autocomplete suggestions appear as you type Python keywords.
- Bracket matching and syntax re-highlighting are handled automatically.

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates key concepts in:

- GUI development using Tkinter  
- Regex-based syntax detection  
- Object-oriented design patterns  
- Event-driven programming  
- Basic lexical analysis

It is a practical resource for learning Python interface development and implementing core features of modern code editors from scratch.
